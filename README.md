# expSignature
Tool to digitally sign an "eman-like" EXP file<p>

Prerequisites :<br>
rename BUREAU.ini to YOUR-COMPUTER-NAME.ini<br>
set moteurEXP to path_to_your_eman_engine.exe<br>
command : expSignature.exe path_to_your_experience_file.exp<br>

# Most common scenario
1°) Sign your (unsigned) EXP file :
![1  sign exp file](https://github.com/chris13300/expSignature/blob/main/expSignature/bin/Debug/1.%20sign%20exp%20file.jpg)

2°) Check the EXP file signature :
![2  check exp file signature](https://github.com/chris13300/expSignature/blob/main/expSignature/bin/Debug/2.%20check%20exp%20file%20signature.jpg)

If someone tries to sign your signed EXP file :
![already signed exp file](https://github.com/chris13300/expSignature/blob/main/expSignature/bin/Debug/already%20signed%20exp%20file.jpg)
